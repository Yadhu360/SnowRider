🏂 2D Snow Slider Game
-----------------------

A fun 2D snowboarding game built in Unity where you ride along curved snowy terrain, perform jumps, and score points while sliding through winter landscapes.
This project is one of my early Unity creations, built while learning 2D physics and movement mechanics.
It helped me understand player control, level design, and smooth game feel.

❄️ Overview
------------
This project is a side-scrolling snowboard game featuring momentum-based movement, slopes, jumps, and multiple themed levels.
The player gains score by moving forward and performing clean landings on curved tracks.
